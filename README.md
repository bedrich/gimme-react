Install node 4, I use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install different versions.

Then: 

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

I have a small file called data.js with all the beans, which are passed in the App file and is passed down to the BeanItem component. When you make a change to the file the webpage will change automatically. Give it a shot, but the h3 tag below the image and watch it update.
